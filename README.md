# Binary Translator

## Description
Binary Translator is a project that I made just to have fun, I don't think it's anything Useful but i think what is cool about it is the GUI as I learned how PyQt5 and PyQt5 Designer work.

## How to install and run the project
Once you download a zip folder of all the files you can extract it and navigate to "Binary Translator.exe" and the app should open just fine.

Alternatively you can open the "main.py" and look at the code, or if you want to see the .ui files for the projects they're available as "MainGUI.ui", "TextToBinaryGUI.ui" and "BinaryToTextGUI.ui" (Note: you can also open them in PyQt5 Designer to view the settings and colors etc).

## How to use the project

In the main menu you can either choose "Text to binary" to translate a text to binary code or "Binary to text" to translate a binary code to a text (self explanatory right? :sweat_smile:)

Once I click one of the two buttons the screen changes as you can see bellow:
